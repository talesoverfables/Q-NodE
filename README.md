# Q-NodE (Quantum Nodal Encryption)

Our vision: To create an end-to-end encrypted communication between multiple users by the transfer of polarised photon (bit-wise data carriers) through fibre optics and node-to-user communication through light fidelity (Li-Fi), the same received through photo voltaic for real-time output display.
